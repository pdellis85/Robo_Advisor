# The Power of the Cloud and Unsupervised Learning

## Background

It is time to take what you have learned about unsupervised learning and the AWS services and apply it to new situations. For this assignment, you will need to complete **one of two** (not both) challenges. Which challenge you take on is your choice. Just be sure to give it your all -- as the skills you hone will become powerful tools in your FinTech tool belt.

### Before You Begin

1. Create a new repository for this project called `unit13-challenge`. **Do not add this homework to an existing repository**.

2. Clone the new repository to your computer.

3. Inside your local git repository, create a directory for the challenge assignment you choose. Use folder names corresponding to the challenges: **RoboAdvisor** or  **ClusteringCrypto**.

4. Add your solution files to this folder.

5. Push the above changes to GitHub or GitLab.

### Background

You were hired as a digital transformation consultant by one of the most prominent retirement plan providers in the country; they want to increase their client portfolio, especially by engaging young people. Since machine learning and NLP are disrupting finance to improve customer experience, you decide to create a robo advisor that could be used by customers or potential new customers to get investment portfolio recommendations for retirement.

In this homework assignment, you will combine your new Amazon Web Services skills with your already mastered Python superpowers, to create a bot that will recommend an investment portfolio for a retirement plan.

You are asked to accomplish the following main tasks:

1. **[Initial Robo Advisor Configuration:](#Initial-Robo-Advisor-Configuration)** Define an Amazon Lex bot with a single intent that establishes a conversation about the requirements to suggest an investment portfolio for retirement.

2. **[Build and Test the Robo Advisor](#Build-and-Test-the-Robo-Advisor):** Make sure that your bot is working and responding accurately along with the conversation with the user, by building and testing it.

3. **[Enhance the Robo Advisor with an Amazon Lambda Function:](#Enhance-the-Robo-Advisor-with-an-Amazon-Lambda-Function)** Create an Amazon Lambda function that validates the user's input and returns the investment portfolio recommendation. This task includes testing the Amazon Lambda function and making the integration with the bot.
